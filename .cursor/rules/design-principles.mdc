# Cursor AI: Design Principles

## **Purpose**
This document outlines the best practice design principles to follow while developing and maintaining the Cursor AI system. Adhering to these principles ensures scalability, maintainability, and clarity.

---

## **Design Principles**

### **1. SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module or class should only have one responsibility or reason to change.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Design modules to be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones to ensure classes only implement what they need.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

### **2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
Avoid code duplication by creating reusable components, functions, or classes.

### **3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
Keep designs straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity. Aim for clarity and simplicity.

### **4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
Avoid implementing features that aren't immediately needed to reduce bloat and complexity.

### **5. Separation of Concerns**
Divide the system into distinct sections (e.g., UI, logic, data access) to improve modularity.

### **6. Encapsulation**
Hide implementation details and expose only what is necessary to ensure security and reduce errors.

### **7. Minimize Coupling**
Design modules to have as few interdependencies as possible to ensure flexibility and ease of testing.

### **8. Maximize Cohesion**
Ensure that elements within a module are strongly related and serve a single purpose.

### **9. Code Readability**
Follow a consistent style guide, use clear variable/method names, and include meaningful comments.

### **10. Testability**
Design modules and components to be easily testable. This includes writing unit tests and using mock objects where applicable.
